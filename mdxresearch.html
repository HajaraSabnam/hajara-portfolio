                    MDX International Undergraduate Student Research Competition 2024, held on December 5, 2024, at Middlesex University Dubai, 
                    brought together students from various disciplines to present innovative research under the theme "Towards a Sustainable Future," 
                    aligned with the UN’s 2030 Agenda. The competition involved abstract submissions, followed by in-person presentations in the 
                    finale, where selected students showcased their research.
                    <br><br>
                    I was honored to be awarded Track Winner – IT for my research paper, "IoT-Driven Real-Time Carbon Emission Monitoring and 
                    Optimization for Heavy Vehicles in the Supply Chain." My research highlighted the overlooked impact of road freight transport 
                    on carbon emissions and proposed an IoT-based framework for real-time monitoring, along with a machine learning model for 
                    predictive maintenance. Representing Amity University Dubai was an incredible experience, and I am grateful to the organizers 
                    and mentors for their support and insights.</p>
