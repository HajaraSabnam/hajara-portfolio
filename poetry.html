                        <p>I wonder,<br>
                            What do these clouds hide?<br>
                            The gloom it’s about to glaze me with<br>
                            Or the glory to conceal the dark?<br>
                            Like it does<br>
                            With itself<br>
                            One can never know, I suppose.<br>
                            And perhaps, that’s the reason<br>
                            It’s too appealing to the eyes<br>
                            Yet so unreal to think about.<br>

                        <p>It feels like just yesterday<br>
                            I came into this world in spring<br>
                            But look, it’s already autumn.<br>
                            Along with the petals of soft flowers,<br>
                            I wished to fly away.<br>
                            But if the flowers perished<br>
                            Where is the beauty of the plant, I thought.<br>
                            And so, I stayed.<br>
                            For a pitied reason<br>
                            Only to find that<br>
                            The plant bore the flowers<br>
                            And hence there is so much green<br>
                            Than the glowing hue<br>
                            To gracefully endow me<br>
                            With a steady and placid life<br>
                            Of opportunities to blossom<br>
                            And not just fugitive flowers <br>
                            That end up faded and forgotten.<br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Lamps of colors blinds the shades of those eyes<br>
                            A beautiful little face<br>
                            Sometimes, she smiles and several times, she frowns<br>
                            Isn’t that how dubious life is?<br>
                            Times filled with happiness and those with pain<br>
                            Before I am done with one, here it is, another one.<br>
                            Before I realize that my hair’s grown a few inches,<br>
                            I feel the wrinkles on my face as I laugh<br>
                            I sometimes look back at that beautiful face<br>
                            That has withered with time<br>
                            Such were the shades, dark and bright<br>
                            Moments I am caged up<br>
                            Now that I think about it,<br>
                            Oh, how lucky am I<br>
                            That you never let go of my hand<br>
                            That you never let me stop<br>
                            That you always made me run with you<br>
                            A savior, I never realized I had<br>
                            Before I put down this pen that I am holding<br>
                            A thousand frowns have let go of me<br>
                            A few smiles have come looking for me<br>
                            Thanks to you, I am still running with you<br>
                            Time changes everything<br>
                            And yet life goes on, doesn’t it?<br>

                        <br>
                        <p>As I put my ear close to the windowpane<br>
                            I feel the breeze with a heavy heart<br>
                            Warm and cold is the usual rhythm<br>
                            But this time, it’s different<br>
                            This wind holds onto stories of many<br>
                            Among troubles, one speaks happiness<br>
                            There’s one with tears too<br>
                            Several throughout the night<br>
                            To keep me well occupied<br>
                            That night filled my ears with words<br>
                            Some I never want to utter<br>
                            Some I wish I had heard earlier<br>
                            In the meantime, this heart forgot<br>
                            What it had been holding the night before<br>
                            Give some thought to it<br>
                            Time passes and so does life, doesn’t it?<br>
                            When there is so much weight in their hearts<br>
                            What am I holding onto?<br>
                            This little soul is blessed, I felt<br>
                            They would feel the same, I thought<br>
                            If they had heard each other<br>
                            In a life filled with troubles<br>
                            There is an ease in sharing<br>
                            In a world filled with such souls<br>
                            There are stories waiting to be shared<br>
                            And this is the music<br>
                            The wind plays every night<br>
                            This time, listen closely<br>
                            You will hear one too.<br>    
                            <br><br>

                            <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>In the dead of the night, when the world fell quiet<br>
                            A voice spoke out of an uncertain conviction.<br>
                            Yearning for a glint, the moonlight embraced her little face<br>
                            A face that has withered over time<br>
                            A heart that had battled itself<br>
                            A mind that forced her to keep fighting<br>
                            She had carried a lot, the miserable woman.<br>
                            But who bothered to ask her, she thought<br>
                            As she reminisced her life, she let out a laugh<br>
                            Soaked in pain, her lips hardly curled<br>
                            Just smile, be elegant.<br>
                            You are a girl, they said.<br>
                            As a sharp pain caught her throat<br>
                            She screamed with tears.<br>
                            Be polite, be quiet.<br>
                            You are a girl, they said.<br>
                            As she prepared to speak<br>
                            Listen to him.<br>
                            Again, you are the girl, they said.<br>
                            And today, as the veil covered her pale face<br>
                            She felt her dreams shatter into pieces<br>
                            Amidst the voices of the unspoken,<br>
                            Her voice stayed mute.<br>
                            Amidst the rules of the unbothered,<br>
                            Her thoughts stayed with her.<br>
                            Amidst their system of life<br>
                            She became a mere puppet.<br>
                            In their world, filled with lights<br>
                            She was devoid of one.<br>
                            And that is how it was supposed to be, they said.<br>
                            But who are they, she thought as she closed her eyes.<br>
                            With filtered emotions, she lifted up her face<br>
                            Hoping that her voice would echo in their unfiltered minds,<br>
                            She opened her eyes.<br>
                            A gentle breeze touched her slow<br>
                            In the soft embrace of the light, she felt a power<br>
                            Of a world that had truly fell silent.<br>
                            And there she disappeared into the moonlight<br>
                            Nowhere to be found again.<br>    
                            <br>                    
                        </p>

                    <div class="poembox">
                        <h2><span class="color1">Pace</span></h2>
                        <br>
                        <p> Time ticks quick<br>
                            But here I stand still<br>
                            Amidst the buzz of a world<br>
                            That never seems to settle<br>
                            To step ahead<br>
                            Means to break barriers<br>
                            To switch circumstances<br>
                            Means to fear and quit<br>
                            Have I lost my time already?<br>
                            But allow me to ask<br>
                            Who times our efforts?<br>
                            A mind racing a heart isn’t life.<br>
                            For, a pace that’s too fast<br>
                            Could never lead to a stable end<br>
                            And hence there is no fault<br>
                            In a pace<br>
                            That’s steady and poise.<br>  
                            <br>                                         
                        </p>
